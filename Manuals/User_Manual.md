## The Homepage

Once logged in, you will be prompted with the homepage. This page contains a menu to start or join singleplayer/multiplayer games. It also gives a summary of the top 10 best players of the game.

### Starting a single player game
It can be desired for the user to play a single player session due to poor network connection or other reasons. To start a single player game, press the arrow button in the single player menu. You will be redirected to a game session instantly.

### Creating a multiplayer lobby
If you want to create a new lobby to play with other people, press the **Create New** button in the quick join menu. This will start a new lobby, and will appear in the quick join menu for players to join.

### Joining an existing lobby
All joinable lobbies are visible in the quick join menu. If you want to join a lobby created by another player, press the arrow button next to the hosts name. Lobbies that are full will not appear in the quick join menu.

### Viewing top players
At the bottom of the page a top players section is displayed. In this section you can see the high scores of the 10 best players of the game. When a user's score exceeds the score of one of these players, they will appear in the top players section.

## The Game Lobby
When creating or joining a lobby, you will be redirected to the waiting room. Here you can see who is waiting for the game to start.

### Inviting people
An invite link is provided at the top of the page. Anyone with this link can join the lobby. Share it with your friends if you want them to play a game with you.

### Starting the game
Only the user who created the lobby is able to start the game. This user is highlighted in orange, so other users know who the host of the lobby is.
- If you are the host of the lobby, start the game by pressing the start game button
- If you are not the host, wait for the host to start the game

:information_source: When the host leaves the lobby, a new host will be assigned to the lobby. The host of the lobby is always highlighted in **orange**

## The Game

The goal of the game is to jump platforms as high as possible.

### Controlling your character
Each individual player is assigned a color. Use the **left and right arrow keys** to control its movement

### Climbing the level
Platforms are all over the level. Your character will jump up and down by itself. By moving left and right you can land on higher platforms to jump higher.

- Normal platforms are stationary
- Moving platforms move from left to right
- Boosted platforms make you jump higher

### Dodging obstacles
Now and then, a meteor comes crashing down the level. Make sure to not hit meteors, as they will kill you instantly. Falling down too deep will also cause you to die instantly.

### Spectating
When a player dies, they will automatically spectate another alive player. The game will end when all players are killed.

## The Game Over Screen

When everyone dies, players will be given a summary of who jumped the highest during the game. The host of the game can continue back to the game lobby, other users have to wait for the host.
